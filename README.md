# Compiler-Design
Few of the important programs related to the Compiler Design

Lab 1: Write a program to construct LL(1) Parser for Deterministic Grammar

Lab 2: Write a program to convert Non deterministic grammar to deterministic grammar. And construct LL(1) parser for the same.

Lab 3: Write a program to eliminate comment lines in a C program and copy the resulting program into a separate file, also recognize valid identifier, operators and keywords in the given text file.

Lab 4: Write a LEX program to recognize valid expression. An expression could be integers or valid identifier and operators could be +, / and *. Count the identifiers & operators present and print them separately.

Lab 5: Write YACC program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators: +, -, *, and /.

Lab 6: Write a program to find leading and trailing for a given operator precedence grammar.

Lab 7: Develop, Implement and Execute a program using YACC tool to recognize all strings ending with b preceded by n aâ€™s using the grammar anbm (note: input n value) where n>=0 and m>0.
